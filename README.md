### owokitty port credits ‚úì‚úì

Unsanctioned WIP fork for Android and other open-source UNIX-like operating systems that are not supported by the normal `sm64ex-coop`, plus improved touchscreen controls. Online multiplayer mod for SM64 that synchronizes all entities and every level for multiple players. Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). Contains code copied from [AloXado320/sm64ex-alo](https://github.com/AloXado320/sm64ex-alo), [VDavid003/sm64-port-android](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android), [VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base](https://github.com/VDavid003/sm64-port-android-base), and [porcino/sm64-port-android](https://github.com/porcino/sm64-port-android).

## How to Play on Android

[Click here to read the guide for Android](README_android.md).

* The easiest way is to download [sm64ex-coop builder Termux](https://github.com/robertkirkman/termux-app/releases/download/v0.1.2/termux-app_v0.1.2+apt-android-7-github-debug_universal.apk)

[Click here to build the `.apk` from a non-Android device](https://github.com/robertkirkman/sm64ex-coop-android-base).

## How to Play on any open-source UNIX-like OS

This repository also contains changes meant to make porting `sm64ex-coop` to open-source UNIX-like operating systems easier (the normal `sm64ex-coop` only supports GNU/Linux and MacOS at the exclusion of others). On many of them, setting up the dependencies (a C and C++ preprocessor and compiler, GNU Make, readline, binutils, Python 3, SDL2, GLEW, an OpenGL or OpenGL ES graphics driver, and an X11-compatible display server) can take many steps that vary dramatically, so I've decided not to make a complete walkthrough for every single one like I have for Android. Once you have all of those configured just right, though, you'll be able to compile and play this way, and hopefully you'll only need to make minor adjustments to the `Makefile` to detect the dependencies the way your OS needs it to.

```
git clone https://github.com/robertkirkman/sm64ex-coop.git
cp /path/to/baserom.us.z64 sm64ex-coop/baserom.us.z64
cd sm64ex-coop
TOUCH_CONTROLS=1 make
build/us_pc/sm64.us.f3dex2e
```

To get you started, I've confirmed my fork to work on the following operating systems (as well as GNU/Linux), and have committed initial changes for them:

‚úÖ postmarketOS

‚úÖ FreeBSD

‚úÖ OpenBSD

There are some bugs when running on them, but I've fixed just enough to get `sm64ex-coop` to compile, launch and host servers with mods in a playable state on them. On OpenBSD and FreeBSD, to build, I install `pkg-config` and temporarily symlink `make` to `gmake`, `gcc` to `clang`, `g++` to `clang++`, and `cpp` to `clang-cpp`. I strongly suspect that if your device has a non-`amd64` architecture and you find bugs, you'll probably want to look through my "`__ANDROID__`" `#ifdef`s in the code and check whether the code I've placed in them turns out to be architecture-related rather than Android-related.

## How to Play on Windows

[Instructions on how to play are available on the wiki.](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop/wiki/How-to-Play)

- The easiest way is to download [coop-compiler](https://github.com/coop-compiler/coop-compiler/releases/latest/download/coop-compiler.exe)

## Goal (accomplished)
Create a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play together online.

Unlike previous multiplayer projects, this one synchronizes enemies and events. This allows players interact with the same world at the same time.

## Lua
sm64ex-coop is moddable via Lua, similar to Roblox and Garry's Mod's Lua APIs. To get started, click [here](docs/lua/lua.md) to see the Lua documentation.
